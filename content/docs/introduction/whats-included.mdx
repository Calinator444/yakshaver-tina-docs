## A Fully Hosted Docs Solution

TinaDocs can be pulled locally and customised to fit your use case and hosted where you like.

It can also be indexed and hosted as is via TinaCloud and Vercel.

> Wait, if there's no database, why do we have TinaCloud?

\<idea callout>

TinaCMS requires a database  somewhere along the line to index your data for efficient fetches, but this isn't used as the source of truth for your content.

We call this a `Datalayer` – and you can also configure your own.

Ultimately with this starter you have the most customisable production ready docs offering. Go wild. 🐺

## Continued Development

**Keep an eye on this starter**.

We have plans to add built-in **versioning** support and additional **styling options** in the near future. 💡

## A Rich Toolset

This template comes with all the basic components needed to make a killer docs site, and some fancy ones too ✨.
