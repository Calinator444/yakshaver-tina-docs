Tina uses [Tailwind CSS](https://tailwindcss.com/) to style components, giving you a powerful and flexible way to customize your site's appearance.

## Using Tailwind CSS

You can customize your site's styling by:

1. Modifying your `tailwind.config.js` file to update colors, fonts, spacing, and other design tokens
2. Applying Tailwind utility classes directly to components
3. Creating custom CSS in your project that extends Tailwind's capabilities

For a complete guide to Tailwind's capabilities, refer to the [official Tailwind CSS documentation](https://tailwindcss.com/docs).

## Component-Specific Styling

You can customize the appearance of specific Tina components ‚Äì the tailwind in the `/app` router and embeds (`/components/tina-markdown`) directories can be updated to match your colour scheme and UI standards.

TinaCMS itself is only coupled to the props defining data for components.

```jsx
// Example: Customizing a Tina component
<TinaComponent className="bg-blue-500 text-white rounded-lg shadow-md" />
```

## Coming Soon... Tina Color Theming üñåÔ∏è

We're working on a more streamlined approach to theme customization. Soon, you'll be able to use Tina-configured color theming to easily adjust your site's color palette through the no-code editor instead.

Stay tuned for updates on this feature in our upcoming releases.
