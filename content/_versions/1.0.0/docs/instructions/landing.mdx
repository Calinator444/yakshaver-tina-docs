## What is TinaCMS?

TinaCMS is an open-source, Git-backed headless content management system (CMS) – it allows you to craft a no-code editing experience on top of your website.

Tina doesn't lock you into a proprietary database. You control your content in the form of Markdown, MDX, and JSON files stored with the power of Git.

The following docs will help you get to grips with the tooling (and create some awesome documentation).

> You can think of Tina more like a tool to craft a custom CMS rather than an all-in-one CMS tool.
