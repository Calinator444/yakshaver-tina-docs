To quickly setup a new Tina starter, from the command line:

```bash
npx create-tina-app@latest
```

From there, you will be prompted a few quick setup questions:

Once your local starter has been created, to run the starter:
`cd <your-starter-name>` into its new directory

Install the projects dependencies (switch out with your respective package managers commands)

```
yarn install
```

Then to run

```bash
yarn dev
```

Next we'll show you how to use the Tina editor!
